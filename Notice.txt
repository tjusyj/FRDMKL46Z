
Changing the Board for Debugging (P&E OpenSDA)
While pressing the reset button, power the board with the OpenSDA USB port
----DEBUG-APP_Pemicro_v108.SDA
copy file from the pack to the BOOTLOADER drive

Changing the Board back to MSD Bootloader (P&E OpenSDA)
----MSD-FRDM-KL46Z48M_Pemicro_v113.SDA
Now the board is in MSD mode, and you can copy S19 files to it.

The bootloader expects the file blocks in a given order,
virus scanner or file manager might interfere with this. 
In that case, use the DOS cmd shell copy command. 
The ‘copy’ command always worked for me.
